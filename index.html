    <h3>Required Texts and Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Cunningham & Cunningham, <em>The Logic of Subchapter K: A Conceptual Guide to the Taxation of Partnerships</em>, 6th ed. (2020). ["Logic"]. </li>  
      
      <li>Cunningham & Cunningham, Logic of Subchapter K Problems (2020)  ["Logic Problems"]</li>

      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wetQOwAdv7NEo5L3KvAjcUYQnxgx5H95qxk6R69QdI/edit?usp=sharing">Errata for the 6th ed.</a></li>
      
      <li>You'll need access to the Code & Regs.  I like CCH, Selected Sections (2021-2022), but you can use the Code & Regs published by West or Foundation.  I recommend that you keep it next to you to mark up during class and while doing the problems and readings.  Feel free to use the version from your basic Income Tax class or one that was published last year--don't worry, it will be fine. Here a pdf of the Code & Regs ('19-'20)</li>
      
      <li>The Code and Regs are available on line at <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research">Tax Materials</a>.  This is a fantastic free database of fundamental tax materials.  On the Supplemental Materials tab, I show how to make a bookmark that will take you directly to the appropriate code or regulation section.  All relevant tax materials are also available on BLaw, WL, Lexis, or Cheetah.</li>
      
      <li>The required Code and Regulations sections that we'll cover for each topic are listed at the beginning of each chapter in Logic Problems.  Additional Code and Regulations sections are listed separately under the topic headings.</li>

      <li>For each topic, first read <em>Logic</em> and then any additional readings and problems.  Use the slides to focus on the important materials that we'll cover during the lectures.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3> Partnership Drafting</h3>

    <ul class="readings">
     <small>
      These articles describe how the tax provisions we discuss in class are reflected in actual PSH agreements.  I've indicated the relevant pages from each article for each topic.  The last two articles discuss the dominant way to draft allocation provisions using target capital accounts.  These are discussed in Logic at pp. 96-104. Throughout the semester, we'll examine various provisions from actual partnership agreements. 
      
      <li>Schenider & O'Connor, PSH and LLC Agreements: Learning to Read and Write Again ["PSH/LLC"]. This is an excellent and clear article on the PSH provisions we will discuss (704(b), 704(c), nonrecourse deductions, etc.) are reflected in actual PSH agreements. It is also a good review for the first 2/3 of the class.</li>
      
      <li>Cavanagh, Targeted Allocations Hit the Spot ["Targeted"]</li>
      
      <li>Goldberg, The Target Method for Partnership Specially Allocations and Why it Should be Safe-Harbored ["Target Method"] . Note, this is a very detailed and in-depth article, but clearly written.</li>
