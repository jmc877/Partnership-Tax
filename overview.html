    <br>

    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Partnership Tax! The goal of this course is to acquaint you
        with the fundamental principles of partnership taxation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The class focuses on understanding the basic U.S. tax regime applicable to domestic partnerships. In particular, we will cover and by the end of the course you should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

        <ul>
          <li>Existence of a partnership or other business arrangement</li>
          <li>Consequences of contributions of property to a partnership</li>
          <li>Understanding partnership operations, including the flexibility in allocating income, gains, and losses among partners</li>
          <li>Special rules applicable to contributions of property with BIG and BIL</li>
          <li>The relationship between liabilities and outside basis</li>
          <li>Partner-partnership transactions</li>
          <li>Sales of partnership interests</li>
          <li>Consequences of distributions</li>
          <li>Disguised sales</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
      <br>
    <p>The knowledge gained in this class is extremely valuable in related corporate law classes, such as M&A, corporate reorganizations, securities regulation, introduction to the deal, venture capital, and private equity. 
    </p> 
    <br>  
      <p>If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one somewhere somehow before graduation. One option is next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way. <a href="Accounting_BSchool.docx">Here are some comments</a> by former students on the class and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit. Here is a good online Wharton course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting#syllabus">Wharton Accounting</a>. There are also free accounting courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you can access through my.fordham.edu.  These look decent:  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/financial-accounting-part-1/the-importance-of-accounting?u=80268241">

    <h3>Class Textbook </h3>

        <p>The book we will use this semester is <em>Corporate Finance </em> (4th ed. 2017) by Ivo Welch.  The book is available for purchase at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/ivo-welch/corporate-finance-fourth-edition/paperback/product-23192069.html">Corporate Finance</a>. An overview and link to the free, online version (note, the pdfs are watermarked) is <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info/home/">here</a>. It is not available at the book store.  I very highly recommend that you order the very reasonably priced print edition.
        </p>
        <br>
  
      <h3>Problem Sets</h3>
   
        <p>You cannot learn the material without practice. You should try to do as many of the problems in the book as you can. Free free to skip those that involve a lot of algebra. I will also assign homeworks (based on prior classes, between 7-10) that will be graded. The homeworks must be typed.You will be assigned numbers so that the homeworks will be graded anonymously. You can work in groups of up to 3. If you work with other
        people, please submit only 1 homework. The due date for each homework will
        be announced when it is posted, and you will generally have 1 week to
        complete it. Late homeworks will not be graded. In computing your
        homework grade, I will drop the lowest score. The homeworks will
        account for roughly 15% of your grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Spreadsheet</h3>
    
        <p>To do almost all of the homework and in class problems, you will
        need to use a spreadsheet program, such as MS Excel, the world's most popular program.  All students have free access to Excel through Fordham. Basic knowledge of Excel is a fundamental business skill, even for lawyers. I've posted some Excel materials on the <em>Additional Resources</em> page.
        </p>
        <br>
        

    <h3>Laptops</h3>

      <p>I allow you to use laptops in the classroom, but that doesn't mean you should use them if you are concerned with doing well: <a href="https://goo.gl/XZxnuP">Laptops</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/corpfin20/NoteTaking_Computer_Summary.pdf? ">Laptops2</a>. I suggest that you print out the powerpoint slides and annotate them with your handwritten notes.
      </p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>Attendance is important. An unreasonable number of absences may result in a lower grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>For any classes that are recorded this semester, the recordings are the property of the instructor, and students may not download or capture the recordings in any manner, share the recordings, or use them for non-class purposes.
