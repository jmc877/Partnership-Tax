        <strong>Partnership Tax: Overview</strong>  
     </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Partnership Tax! The goal of this course is to acquaint you
        with the fundamental principles of partnership taxation. 
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      The class focuses on understanding the basic U.S. tax regime applicable to domestic partnerships. In particular, we will cover and by the end of the course you should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

        <ul>
          <li>Existence of a partnership or other business arrangement</li>
          <li>Consequences of contributions of property to a partnership</li>
          <li>Understanding partnership operations, including the flexibility in allocating income, gains, and losses among partners</li>
          <li>Special rules applicable to contributions of property with BIG and BIL</li>
          <li>The relationship between liabilities and outside basis</li>
          <li>Partner-partnership transactions</li>
          <li>Sales of partnership interests</li>
          <li>Consequences of distributions</li>
          <li>Disguised sales</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
      <br>
    <p>The knowledge gained in this class is extremely valuable in related corporate law classes, such as real estate and real estate finance, introduction to the deal, venture capital, and private equity. 
    </p> 
    <br>  
      <p>If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one somewhere somehow before graduation. One option is next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way. <a href="Accounting_BSchool.docx">Here are some comments</a> by former students on the class and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit. Here is a good online Wharton course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting#syllabus">Wharton Accounting</a>. There are also free accounting courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you can access through my.fordham.edu.  These look decent:  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/financial-accounting-part-1/the-importance-of-accounting?u=80268241">

    </p>
    
    <h3>Class Textbook </h3>

        <p>The book we'll use this semester is Cunningham & Cunningham, The Logic of Subchapter K: A Conceptual Guide to the Taxation of Partnerships, 6th ed. (2020) (Logic).  It may be the best written law student guide.
        </p>
    
  
    <h3>Code and Regulations</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need access to the Code & Regs. I like <a href="https://shoptax.wolterskluwer.com/en/fed-inc-tx-code-reg-sel-sec-2025ypi.html">CCH, Selected Sections (2024-2025) </a> (paper version)  or <a href="https://www.cchcpelink.com/product/detail/?p=29204">CCH, Selected Sections (2024-2025)</a> (ebook), but the Code & Regs published by West or Foundation are fine. I recommend that you keep it next to you to mark up during class and while doing the problems and readings. Feel free to use the version from your basic federal income tax class or one that was published last year, provided that it has the partnership code and regulation provisions.  Don't worry, an older version will be fine.</li>

        <li>Here a pdf of the <a href="IRC_19_20.pdf">CCH '19-'20 Selected Sections</a>.  There have been very few changes to the partnership provisions since then.</li>
    
        <li>The Code and Regs are available free on line at <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research">Tax Materials</a>. This is a fantastic free database of fundamental tax materials, such as the code, regulations, cases and administrative materials. On the Supplemental Materials tab, I show how to make a bookmark that will take you directly to the appropriate code or regulation section. All relevant tax materials are also available on BLaw, WL, Lexis, or VitalLaw.</li>

        <li>Here is a link to the <a href="IRC Nov 2024.pdf"> Full IRC</a> as of November, 2024, in all of its full glory, such as amendment history, statutory notes, and effective dates.  Finally, you can make your own nicely formatted Code & Regs for free here:  <a href="https://www.lawskypracticeproblems.org/codeandregs">Lawsky Code & Regs</a></li>
    
        <li>The required Code and Regulations sections that we'll cover for each topic are listed at the beginning of each chapter in Logic Problems. Additional Code and Regulations sections are listed separately under the topic headings. </li>
      
        <li>For each topic, first read <em>Logic</em> and then any additional readings and problems.  Use the slides to focus on the important materials that we'll cover during the lectures.</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h3>Problem Sets</h3>
   
        <p>For each topic, we'll cover problems that are designed to reinforce the sometimes very difficult materials.   I will assign the problems to particular students.  I highly recommend that you work on the problems in teams.
        </p>

    <h3>Spreadsheet</h3>
    
        <p>Many of the problems are best done in Excel, the world's most popular program.  All students have free access to Excel through Fordham. Basic knowledge of Excel is a fundamental business skill, even for lawyers. I've posted some Excel materials on the <em>Additional Resources</em> page.
        </p>
           

    <h3>Laptops</h3>

      <p>I allow you to use laptops in the classroom, but that doesn't mean you should use them if you are concerned with doing well: <a href="https://goo.gl/XZxnuP">Laptops</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/corpfin20/NoteTaking_Computer_Summary.pdf? ">Laptops2</a>. I suggest that you print out the powerpoint slides and annotate them with your handwritten notes.
      </p>

    <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>Attendance is important. An unreasonable number of absences may result in a lower grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>For any classes that are recorded this semester, the recordings are the property of the instructor, and students may not download or capture the recordings in any manner, share the recordings, or use them for non-class purposes.
